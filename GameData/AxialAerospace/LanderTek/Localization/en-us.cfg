		#LTEK-science-goo-titl = Mystery Goo™ - LanderTek Edition
		#LTEK-science-goo-desc = This unit was something one of our engineers came upon while dumpster divin-- Erm, while researching alternative applications for existing technologies. It's a sealed container which appears to be filled with a strange-looking substance. We couldn't reach in or break the canister open, but watching how the Goo behaves when subjected to different situations could be very educational.

		#LTEK-science-matbay-titl = LanderTek Materials Bay
		#LTEK-science-matbay-desc = Identical to the stock materials bay (science jr.).  Except they look nothing alike.  So not really identical at all.  But with all the same buttons... err... we think.

		#LTEK-science-sample-titl = LanderTek Sample Return Container
		#LTEK-science-sample-desc = Storage Container for Science Data - Useful for returning data, samples, reports, etc.

		#LTEK-ltskycrane-titl = LT Sky Crane
		#LTEK-ltskycrane-desc = Skycrane... crane in the sky.
