## Introduction by [`artwhaley`][artwhaley]

> It's always bugged me that the stock parts don't lend themselves to building compact realistic-ish' landers. Landers are built light and boxy with an emphasis on low COG's, lightweight parts, and plenty of good places to attach the gizmos they'll need on the surface. Nasa doesn't like trying to keep a 2.5m round, 12 m high lander from tipping over anymore than we do. These parts don't match the stock parts in terms of volume of fuel in volume of space... justify it by saying that lander parts are built lighter than launcher tanks and such... or... just don't worry about it! KSP is a game and the scale of things doesn't work out perfectly in it, but I think these parts are a good balance of realism/fun.
